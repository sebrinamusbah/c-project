# Simple C++ Program

## Description
This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates basic programming concepts such as input/output, variables, loops, and conditional statements.  
*(Replace this with a short description of what your program actually does, e.g., "This program calculates the factorial of a number" or "This program simulates a basic calculator.")*
